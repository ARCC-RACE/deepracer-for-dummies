# DeepRacer-For-Cloud
Provides a quick and easy way to get up and running with a DeepRacer training environment in Azure or AWS, using either the Azure [N-Series Virtual Machines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/sizes-gpu) or [AWS EC2 Accelerated Computing instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/?nc1=h_ls#Accelerated_Computing).

This repo started as an extension of the work done by Alex (https://github.com/alexschultz/deepracer-for-dummies), which is again a wrapper around the amazing work done by Chris (https://github.com/crr0004/deepracer). With the introduction of the second generation Deepracer Console the repository has been split up. This repository contains the scripts needed to *run* the training, but depends on Docker Hub to provide pre-built docker images. All the under-the-hood building capabilities have been moved to my [Deepracer Build](https://gitbub.com/larsll/deepracer-build) repository.

Main differences to the work done by Alex is:
* Runtime S3 storage is setup to fit the connected cloud platform:
	* Azure: Local 'virtual' S3 instance (minio) is now using an Azure Storage Account / Blob Storage as a back-end. This allows for access between sesssions using e.g. Storage Explorer (https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/features/storage-explorer/).
	* AWS: Directly connects to a real S3 bucket.
* Robomaker and Log Analysis containers are extended with required drivers to enable Tensorflow to use the GPU. Containers are all pre-compiled and available from Docker Hub.
* Configuration has been reorganized :
	* `custom_files/hyperparameters.json` stores the runtime hyperparameters, which logically belongs together with the model_metadata.json and rewards.py files.
	* `system.env` contains system-wide constants (expected to be configured only at setup)
	* `run.env` contains user session configuration (pretraining, track etc.) as well as information about where to upload your model (S3 bucket and prefix).
	* `docker/.env` remains the home for more static configuration. This is not expected to change between sessions.
